# Bug Tracker

Full stack CRUD Bug Tracker.

Tech stack used:
- React
- TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit
- TailwindCSS

- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB
- JWT for authorization
- Bcrypt to hash passwords

Full stack app I've created to follow bugs that appear on my personal projects. I'll probably keep working on it to make it a bit prettier and more responsive.
Hashing all passwords on signup and JWT tokens expire after 7 days. 

Some features on the website:
- Project creation
- Role based features (Only admin can delete projects etc)
- Comments/Notification system that lets everyone know if a change happens on the project they're assigned to.
- Demo users (You can view the app as a user/dev/admin and see the differences)
